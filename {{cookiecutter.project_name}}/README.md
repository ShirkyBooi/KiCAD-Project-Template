## Project Structure

This project is organized into four main directories:

- [**datasheets**](./datasheets/README.md): This directory is used to store all related datasheets for the design. These include component datasheets, technical specifications, or any data that supports the design and helps in understanding the components used in the project.

- [**docs**](./docs/README.md): This directory contains all documentation regarding the design decisions, mechanical components, and PCB/Schematic considerations. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the project's design process, component selection, and implementation strategy.

- [**hardware**](./hardware/README.md): This directory contains the actual design files and KiCAD project, which have been generated by the template, as well as the submodule for our KiCAD Library. It serves as the main workspace for all hardware design and development activities.

- [**production**](./production/README.md): This directory is used to store the files necessary for production and manufacturing. These include the Bill of Materials (BoM), CAD files, Gerbers, and Pick and Place files, essential for the successful transition of the design from prototyping to mass production.

Each directory contains a README.md file that provides additional details on how to use the files contained within.

## How to Contribute

Engineers working on this project may work in either the `master` or `development` branch. However, before the board gets manufactured, the project should branch to `development` and submit a pull request to `master`. We will then review and make suggestions. Once reviewed, the updates can be committed and the `development` branch can be merged into `master`.

After the board is manufactured, it should be tagged and given a name on the repository to maintain a record of the specific version of the design files used in the manufacturing. Here is a guide to do that:

1. Tag the latest commit: Use the command `git tag -a v1.0 -m "your message here"` where `v1.0` is the tag and the message is a description of this version.
2. Push the tag to the repository: Use the command `git push origin v1.0` to push your tag to the repo. Replace `v1.0` with your tag name.
