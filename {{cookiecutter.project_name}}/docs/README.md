# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation directory for the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} project. This directory houses all the critical documents, from high-level design documents to detailed hardware considerations. 

## Structure

The documentation directory is broken down into two main sub-directories:

1. [Design](./design/README.md) - This folder is reserved for overall design documents such as project requirements, specifications, and system architecture. 

2. [Hardware](./hardware/README.md) - This folder contains detailed documentation on the mechanical and electrical design (PCB and Enclosure). 

## Changelog

The changelog is an important part of the documentation. It records the major changes between each project revision, making it easier to track the project's evolution over time.

We encourage project contributors to maintain a thorough changelog. It should contain:

- A list of all significant modifications, improvements, and bug fixes made to the project in each version.
- A brief description of why the changes were necessary.
- The date of the changes.

## Contribution

Contributors should add appropriate documentation for all aspects of the project, following the established structure. Each major version should include an update to the changelog, noting the changes and improvements made.

Having thorough, updated, and accessible documentation is crucial for the project's success, so we appreciate your contributions to keeping this directory comprehensive and up-to-date.
